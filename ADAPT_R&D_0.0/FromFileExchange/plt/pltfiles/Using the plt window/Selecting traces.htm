<p>If more than one y-vector argument was given to plt, a trace selection box will appear 
in the upper left corner of the plt window. Note: when using sub-plots, only the 
main plot (lower left) includes a trace selection box.</p>

<p>In the example shown to the left, plt has been given five y-vectors to plot. The name of each 
trace and the colors used to plot them are also given. Usually you should give 
each trace a more informative name, but in this case no trace names were 
specified on the command line, so plt just named each trace with a number. The 
trace IDs associated with traces 2 and 3 are shown in an italic normal weight 
font, indicating that they are currently disabled (not visible). The other three 
trace IDs are shown in a bold upright font, indicating that those traces are 
enabled in the plot area.<br clear="left">
<br>
Below is a list of the ways you can control which traces are displayed. If 
you are plotting just a few traces, the first bullet should cover all that you 
need to know. However since plt can plot up to 99 traces, the remaining tricks 
may come in handy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you left click on one of the trace names in the trace selection box, 
  the associated trace is toggled on or off.</li>
  <li>To view a single trace all by itself, right click on the trace name of 
  interest. That trace will be enabled and all the others will be disabled.</li>
  <li>Double click on any of the trace names to enable all traces at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the plot uses a right hand axis, plt indicates which traces are plotted on 
the right hand axis by adding some shading to the background of the trace ID. 
For instance, in this example, traces 1,3,4, and 5 are plotted on the right hand 
axis. The use of italics to indicate inactive traces, and the methods for 
enabling/disabling traces are the same no matter which axes are used. (Traces 2 
and 4 are disabled in this example.)</p><br clear="left">

<p>If the TraceMK argument was used, then the line types are also shown in the 
trace selection box. An example of this is shown here which used 'TraceMK',.6 in 
the plt argument list. The .6 indicates that the first 60% of the width is used 
for the trace names and the remaining width is used to show the line types. See
<a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Trace%20properties.htm">Trace Properties</a> 
for more detail on the TraceMK parameter.</p><br clear="left">

<p>When the line types are included in the trace selection box, you may 
enable/disable traces by clicking on the trace name as described above, or by 
clicking on the line type to the right of the trace name. In this example traces 
3,4 and 5 have been disabled. The trace names for the disabled traces are shown 
in italics as usual and the line types are also grayed out (actually blue/green) 
to make it clear that these traces are not currently visible in the plot area.

<p>Since left or right clicking on the line types serves the same purpose as
left/right clicking on the trace names, you can dispense with the trace
names altogether if you like. (This mode is selected by specifying assigning
less than 25% of the width to the trace names, i.e. a TraceMK parameter of less than .25).
In the example to the left, the TraceMK parameter was 0.1 and note that the first
trace has been disabled.</p>
