Plt has the capability to modify the plotted data, either one
point at a time or over a specified range. Data entry is accomplished
by entering the coordinates via the keyboard or by using the mouse
when keyboard accuracy is not required. (An alternate method of data 
editing appropriate for short data sequences is described in the
<a href="Menu%20box.htm">Menu box </a>section.)<br>
<br>
  <img alt="" class="auto-style1" height="237" src="../images/DataEdit.png" style="float: left" width="92">The 
  first step is to click on the trace containing the data that you wish to edit. 
  The second step is to right click on the Ycursor edit box. (This is 
  the edit box closest to the lower right corner of the figure.) When you do 
  that, a popup menu will appear with a list of 12 choices. I will describe the 
  first choice (<span class="mcode">Properties</span>) first, although it doesn't really have anything to 
  do with data editing. (It was thrown in here for a lack of a better place to 
  put it.) One of three different property editing windows will appear depending 
  on how it is selected. When you left click on &quot;Properties&quot; a window appears which allows you 
  to modify the color and other properties of the currently selected line and 
  its cursor. If before clicking on &quot;Properties&quot; you enable delta cursor mode 
  (&Delta; button) then a property windows  
  appears which allows you to edit all the lines at once. This is probably often 
  appropriate for the color property, but it may be useful for some of the other 
  trace properties, such as linewidth. And finally, if instead of left 
  clicking you right click on 
  &quot;Properties&quot; then a window appears that allows you to 
  edit the figure colors. This is the easiest method of accessing the three 
  property editing windows, 
  although for historical reasons there are two additional ways of opening 
  these windows. One is via the &quot;Colors/Lines&quot; selection of the menu bar and the 
  other is via right clicking the &quot;Mark&quot; tag in the menu box. Both of these 
  methods are mentioned in the <a href="Menu%20box.htm">Menu box </a> &nbsp;section 
  which also has a full description of the three different property editing windows 
  and how to use them.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 30; margin-bottom: -10">
The second choice in this menu (<span class="mcode">Cancel</span>) is 
useful if you opened this popup menu accidently or when 
you want to abort an already initiated data editing operation.</p>
<br>
The remaining selections in this popup contain the actual data editing commands. 
The descriptions below are written for completeness rather 
than brevity so don't be scared off. The commands are intuitive, so you may be better off skipping the descriptions at first 
in favor of experimentation. The nine editing commands are divided into these three types:<br><br>

<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#C0C0C0" width="100%" id="AutoNumber2">
  	<tr>
		<td style="width: 67px" class="auto-style4"><strong>Modify</strong></td>
		<td>The modify commands change the x or y (or both) coordinates of a 
		single data point. When using these commands, the length of 
		the x and y vectors do not change. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 67px" class="auto-style4"><strong>Insert</strong></td>
		<td>The insert commands add a new xy data pair to the data at the 
		current cursor point. When using these data editing commands, the length 
		of the x and y vectors increase by one. The one exception to that is that
		when you attempt to add a new data pair with its y value less than the
		current minimum y-axis limit, then the data at the current cursor point
		is removed from the data set (i.e. the length of the x and y vectors
		decrease by one).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 67px" class="auto-style4"><strong>Range</strong></td>
		<td>With the range commands (as with modify) the length of 
		the x and y vectors remain the same. However in this case more than one 
		data point is changed. All the data points between the current cursor 
		location and the location modified during the previous data editing 
		command are modified so that all these points lie on a straight line 
		connecting the two end locations. For this to work, the previously 
		edited point and the current cursor location must both lie on the same 
		line. If this is not true, then the Range commands 
		behave just like the Modify commands described above, and you will know
		happened because the cursor shape will be consistant with a Modify
		command. (See cursor shapes table below).</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
The nine commands are also catagorised into three modes identified by the arrows next to each command as follows:
<br><br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#C0C0C0" width="100%" id="AutoNumber2">
  <tr>
    <td align="right" class="auto-style2" style="width: 163px"><font size="4">
	<strong>Modify&uarr;&darr;<br>Insert&uarr;&darr;<br>Range&uarr;&darr;</strong></font></td>
    <td width="90%">These are the three most commonly used data editing modes. As soon as you select the 
	editing mode, the regular data cursor disappears and is replaced by an 
	editing cursor with a different shape. (See data editing cursor shapes 
	below). Then you can grab the edit cursor with the mouse and drag it to the 
	desired location. However you will only be able to move the cursor up and 
	down (i.e. only the y coordinate is 
    allowed to change). Normally as soon as you release the mouse button (after 
	the edit cursor has been dragged to its new location) the edit command will 
	take effect, the edit cursor will disappear, and the normal data cursor will 
	reappear. However if instead of using the normal left mouse button, you drag the edit cursor 
	using the right mouse button, then when you release the mouse the edit 
	command will take effect but the edit cursor will remain active. This makes 
	it easier to see the effect of the edit and easily re-adjust if necessary. 
	Once you are satisfied with the edit command you can regain the normal data 
	cursor mode by selecting &quot;Cancel&quot; (the second popup option mentioned above) 
	or more quickly just by clicking anywhere in the plot area other than the 
	edit cursor itself. In addition to moving the edit cursor with the mouse, 
	you can also move the edit cursor more precisely by typing a new y value 
	into the Ycursor edit box. (You can also modify the x coordinate by typing a new x value into the Xcursor edit box despite the fact that you can't 
	change the x value when using the mouse.) After you type a value into 
	either the x or y cursor edit box, the edit command takes effect and the 
	data edit mode is immediately canceled and the original data cursor is 
	restored (i.e. there is no provision for a delayed exit from edit mode like 
	you get using the right mouse button). If you would rather stay in edit mode 
	until cancelled explicitly, just use one of the three commands without any 
	arrows after it (described below). </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
 <td align="right" class="auto-style2" style="width: 163px"><font size="4">
	<strong>Modify&harr;<br>Insert&harr;<br>Range&harr;</strong></font></td>
    <td width="90%">These three commands behave identically to the three 
	commands described above except for the fact that with the mouse you can 
	only drag the cursor left or right (i.e. only the x coordinate 
    is allowed to change).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right" style="width: 163px"><font size="4">
    <strong>Modify<br>Insert<br>Range</strong></font></td>
    <td width="90%">When using these three commands 
	you can use the mouse to drag the edit cursor anywhere. As before the 
	editing mode is cancelled as soon as you release the mouse button (unless you 
	used the right mouse button). As mentioned above, the use of 
	the X and Y cursor edit boxes is slightly different in that it stays in edit 
	mode until you cancel it explicitly (usually by clicking anywhere in the 
	plot area).</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-top: 30; margin-bottom: -10">
<img alt="" class="auto-style1" height="194" src="../images/EditCur.png" style="float: left" width="92">The 
usual data cursor is a plus sign or a small circle. Once you select one of the 
nine editing modes, the data cursor changes to one of the nine edit cursors 
shown in this figure. Although it wouldn't really be necessary to have a different 
cursor for each mode, it does help you remember what mode you are currently in. 
If you don't like the default size that plt chooses for the data edit cursors, 
you can change this with a command such as: <span class="mcode">
setappdata(gcf,'CurEdit',14)</span>. The new size will be used the next time a 
cursor edit mode is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 30; margin-bottom: -10">
If plt was called using the <span class="mcode">MotionEdit</span> parameter, the 
function specified with that parameter will be called continuously as you 
drag the edit cursor around. This function may be used to create or modify text, 
plots or other gui objects on the screen. (see
<a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Cursor%20commands.htm">Mouse Motion 
Functions</a>)</p>

<br>If you want to save the altered data (to a file for example) you have to get the 
data from the 'xdata' and 'ydata' properties of the line handle. (Remember the 
line handles are returned by the plt call.) When the user modifies any data 
using these data editing functions, plt executes the user specified move cursor 
callback. (See the description of the <span class="mcode">'set','moveCB'</span> 
function <a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Cursor%20commands.htm">here</a>.) 
The callback routine or any other part of your application can use the <span class="mcode">'NewData'</span> 
application property of the current figure window to determine if data has been 
modified by one of the data edit commands. For example:<br clear="left">

<br><span class="mcode">index = getappdata(gcf,'NewData'); &nbsp;&nbsp; </span>% returns the index where xdata/ydata was modified
<br><span class="mcode">if index
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> % is there any new data?
<br><span class="mcode">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataWasModifiedAction(index);</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; % 
yes, process the new data
<br><span class="mcode">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setappdata(gcf,'NewData',0);</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % indicate that the data was already processed
<br><span class="mcode">end;</span>
<br><br>Note that the
<span class="mcode">NewData</span> property only gets set after a data edit 
operation is complete, unlike the <span class="mcode">MotionEdit</span> function 
which gets called as you are dragging a cursored value to its new location. 
There is one additional figure application data variable called
<span class="mcode">Dedit</span> that may also be useful for an application 
using the data editing feature. The command <span class="mcode">
getappdata(gcf,'Dedit')</span> will return a row vector. The 1st element of this 
vector contains the cursor ID number associated with the edited trace. The 2nd 
element contains a number from 1 to 9 which identifies which data edit command 
was last used. (This is starting from the top of the popup, so 1 indicates the 
&quot;Range&quot; selection). The 3rd element contains the handle of the cursor object 
associated with the modified data.<p style="margin-top: 30; margin-bottom: -10">
After performing a data edit operation it is pretty likely that you will want to 
perform another data edit using the same data edit command. Thus it would be 
nice if you could initiate another data edit operation without having to again 
select one of the nine data editing operations. In fact there is a way to do 
this - simply right click on the Xcursor edit box. This behaves similarly to 
what happens when you right click on the Ycursor edit box except you don't get 
the menu of data editing choices, since it will use your previous selection. 
There has to be a default for this operation in case the user right clicks on 
the Xcursor edit box before doing any other data edit operation. The default is 
&quot;Modify&quot; since this is the most commonly used operation. It is rare 
to want to change this default, although it is not difficult to do so. In fact the
<span class="mcode">demo\editz.m</span> demo program changes this default, so 
refer to that example to see how it is done.</p>
