<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By default, the menu box contains 8 items. Some or all of these items may be 
missing if they were specifically excluded by using the <span class="mcode">'Options'</span> 
argument in the calling sequence. See <span class="mcode">pltquiv.m</span> for an example of
how you can add a new menu box function. Clicking on the menu box items has the following 
effect:<br clear="left">
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Help</h3>

<p>On Windows systems when you left or right click on the the
<span class="mcode">Help</span> tag, plt will display the file
<span class="mcode">plt.chm</span>. On Unix and other systems the browser 
will be opened to display the file
<span class="mcode">plt.htm</span> (since these systems don't support the 
chm file format). The left click behavior may be modified by including the
<span class="mcode">'HelpFile'</span>  parameter on the command line and
the right click behavior may be modified by including the
<span class="mcode">'HelpFileR'</span>  parameter. Those parameters are described
<a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Options.htm">here</a>.</p>

<h3>LinX</h3>

<p>Left clicking this tag changes the x-axis scale from linear to logarithmic.
The name of the tag itself also toggles between <span class="mcode">LinX</span>
and <span class="mcode">LogX</span> so that it the tag name always matches the
current x-axis scaling type. Left clicking again toggles it back to
<span class="mcode">LinX</span>.</p>
Right clicking this tag swaps the x and y data for all the traces which has the
effect of displaying the inverse function of the original display. This swapping
is not possible when a right hand axes is being used, and in that case the right
click is simply ignored.

<h3>LinY</h3>

<p>The y-axis scale changes from linear to logarithmic. This tag also changes to
<span class="mcode">LogY</span> so that it always matches the current scaling of 
the y-axis. Clicking again toggles it back to <span class="mcode">LinY</span>.
The print dialog box is accessed by clicking on the <span class="mcode">Print</span>
tag (see below), but since this is not often used, by default the print tag does
not appear in the menu box. However, although it is less obvious you can also
bring up the print dialog box by right clicking on this LinY/LogY tag.
</p>

<h3>Grid</h3>

<p>Left clicking on the Grid tag alternates between no grids (tick marks only)
and full grids on both x and y axes. By default, the grids are solid dim grey lines.
(This may be modified by the GRIDc and GridStyle parameters.)
Grid lines with high contrast colors and brightness (such as what you get with the
native Matlab plot command) makes it more difficult to observe the main data traces.

Assuming the grid style has not been modified with the GRIDc or GridStyle parameters,
then right clicking on the Grid tag will alternate between the following two grid modes:
<ul>
  <li><tt><b>&nbsp;Color = [.13 .13 .13],&nbsp; LineStyle = '-',&nbsp; EraseMode = 'xor'</b></tt> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>(default)</i></li>
  <li><tt><b>&nbsp;Color = [.26 .26 .26],&nbsp; LineStyle = ':',&nbsp; EraseMode = 'normal'</b></tt></li>
</ul>
The 'xor' mode generally looks better, although it sometimes produces display anomolies with
some OS/graphics renderer combinations.
</p>

<h3>Zout</h3>

<p>Each left click of the <span class="mcode">Zout</span> (Zoom out) tag expands the 
x and y axes by 40% (20% at each end). This approximately doubles the area of 
the cartesian plane displayed within the axis limits. (1.4<sup>2</sup> = 1.96). 
Right clicking on the <span class="mcode">Zout </span>reverses the effect of a 
left click (i.e. zooms in).</p>

<h3>XY<font face="Times New Roman">&#8596;</font></h3>

<p>Each click on the <span class="mcode">XY<font face="Times New Roman">&#8596;</font></span> 
(XYrotate) tag cycles the x and y axis limits to the next 
display expansion stored in a history list. (The axis limits from the last four 
zooms or pans are saved in this list). After all the display limits in the 
history list are used, the next click autoscales both axes so that all the data 
is displayed. The next click again uses the first display expansion in the 
history list.</p>

<h3>Print</h3>

<p>Note that the <span class="mcode">Print</span> tag does not appear in the 
menu box by default. It will only appear if enabled by an <span class="mcode">'Options'</span> 
argument in the calling sequence.</p>

<p>
<img border="0" src="../images/Hardcopy.png" align="left" hspace="10"></p>

<p>Assuming you did enable it, when you click on 
this Print tag this &quot;HardCopy&quot; dialog box will appear. The primary use of 
this dialog box is to create BMP images of the plt window. (You will see from 
the popup menu, that you can select other graphics formats as well, although not 
all of them are well tested). For all 
file types except BMP, the colors are inverted if the background is dark. On 
most printers this makes the copy far more readable and saves large amounts of 
toner.</p>

<p>The reason that this tag is off by default is that 
it can also be reached from the &quot;HardCopy&quot; submenu of the File menu in the menu 
bar, and that is the preferred way to access it. If you don't see the menu bar, 
click on the <span class="mcode">Menu</span> tag in the menu box to make the 
menu bar visible.</p>

<p>You can also print directly to the default windows printing device from the HardCopy menu, however an easier (and prossibly more reliable) way of doing this 
is to select &quot;print&quot; from the File menu). And finally, often the 
windows screen capture facility (via the PrintScreen key) is often the most 
appropriate method. To enhance the screen capture method, before pressing 
PrintScreen you can right click on the y-axis label. This hides the menu box and 
cursor objects so these objects won't distract from the basic plot data. Right 
clicking on the y-axis label a second time re-enables the cursor objects.</p>

<h3>Mark</h3>

<p>
<img border="0" src="../images/Marker.png" width="171" height="108" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></p>

<p>When you left click on the Mark tag, a circular mark is placed at the current 
cursor location and a text string is added to the plot containing the x and y 
coordinates of the cursor location. The text string will be the same color as the active trace. If the text label is not positioned where you 
want it, click on the label and drag it to the desired location.<br clear="left">
&nbsp;</p>

<div align="left">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100" id="AutoNumber2" align="left">
    <tr>
      <td>
      <img border="0" src="../images/MarkerEdit.png" width="307" height="124" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <img border="0" src="../images/MarkerEdit2.png" width="308" height="238" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <img border="0" src="../images/MarkerEdit3.png" width="308" height="270" hspace="10" vspace="10"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>If you right click on the text label, a new dialog box will appear which 
allows you to change any or all of the properties of both the trace marker and 
the text string. The two pictures below show the Marker and String properties 
respectively that you can edit. Note that both the Marker and the String popups 
have <span class="mcode">delete</span> as one of the options. This is useful if 
you want to put a marker without a string or a string without a marker. You may 
delete all the markers you have added this way by selecting <span class="mcode">
delete</span> and then typing <span class="mcode">all</span> into the edit box 
below the popup. The same trick works for deleting all the strings added to the 
figure via the Mark tag. Note that you can have many of these Edit Marker dialog 
boxes open at same time - as many as one per text string (or even more, although 
there is probably little benefit to that). All these dialog boxes will be 
deleted automatically if the main plot window is deleted.</p>

<p>Once you select one of the 8 marker properties, or one of the 10 string 
properties, the current value of the property appears in the respective edit 
box. To change the property value, click in the edit box, and type in a new 
value.</p>

<p>Note that when you select the <span class="mcode">color</span> property, the 
property value is a set of three numbers corresponding to red, green, and blue 
respectively. Each number is an intensity value and must range from zero (off) 
to 1.0 (full intensity). You may change the color by entering the desired rgb 
values. When you press &lt;Enter&gt; the new value will be accepted and you will see 
the marker or string change to the new color. However since it is often 
difficult to predict exactly what these colors look like, plt provides an easier 
way to select new colors. Instead of left clicking on the rgb triple, use a 
right click. A new color section box will appear. The use of the color selection 
box appears below, since the same dialog box is used to adjust figure and line 
colors.<br clear="left">
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Menu</h3>

<p>The menu bar is not visible by default (unless <span class="mcode">
'options','m'</span> appears in the argument list) but may be enabled by 
left clicking on the Menu tag. For a description of the options available
from the menu bar, see the section below (Menu Bar).
<br><br>
<img border="0" src="../images/CursorData.png" vspace="5" align="left" hspace="10"></p>
Right clicking on the Menu tag opens up a new window similar to this one shown called
the  <b><i><font size="+1"> Cursor Data Window </font></i></b>. This window shows the
x and y values of all visible plot traces. The down arrows
(<span class="mcode">vvvvvv</span>) highlighted in the middle of this window indicate
that the cursor is currently pointing to the 199th data element of the trace
whose trace ID is "Line 2". As you move the cursor around (by any of the many methods)
the cursor data window will automatically be updated so that arrows always point to
the current cursor location. The cursor index will always be shown near the middle
of the window but you can use the scrollbar on the right side of the figure to view
any of the data values that appear on the plot.
<br><br>
The first column heading is always "index" and the index column will contain all the
integers between 1 and n, where n is the data length of the longest visible trace.
The second column heading is always "X" which indicates that this column contains the
Xdata values of the first visible trace. The 3rd column will contain the y values
of the first visible trace and the column heading will be the traceID. The 4th column
will again have a heading of "X" and will contain the x data for the 2nd visible trace
except (as in this example) when the x values are the same as for the previous trace
in which case the X column is omitted. In this example all 3 traces had the same x vector
so only one column is needed for it. However if the 3 traces each had different x vectors
then the column headings would have been <i>"index,X,Line1,X,Line2,X,Line3"</i>.
<br><br>
If the characters are two big or small for your taste you can adjust the size with the
fontsize popup. Click the save button to create a text file that contains the exact text
that appears in the list box (from index 1 all the way to the end of each trace).
The column headings will appear at the very top of the text file.
<br><br>
Note that if you are using subplots, some of the column headings may be blank since
the subplot traces do not use TraceIDs. However if a subplot has a y-axis label
then that label will be used as column heading for the trace inside the subplot.
<br clear="left">

<h2>Menu Bar</h2>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/Menu.png"></p>
<p>If plt is compiled into an .exe application, only the 
first and last menus (<span class="mcode">File</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="mcode">Color/Lines</span>) will appear. (The other menu items depend on the MatLab application, 
so it must be installed and running.)</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../images/FileMenu.png" vspace="5" align="right" hspace="10"></p>
<p>
The most useful function of the menu bar for most plt applications is <span class="mcode">
Print</span>, the last item under the <span class="mcode">
File</span> menu. This is probably the easiest and most reliable way to make a 
hardcopy of the plt window. As you can see is this picture, plt adds the 
following three items to the File menu:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <span class="mcode">
  plt&nbsp;save </span>saves the current figure so that that it can be opened later 
  (see plt open below). A dialog box opens allowing you to choose the name of 
  the file. A .plt extension is used for these files although in fact they are 
  ordinary .mat files. This menu item is equivalent to typing <span class="mcode">
  plt&nbsp;save</span> at the Matlab command prompt. Also at the command prompt, you 
  may type <span class="mcode">
  plt&nbsp;save&nbsp;filename</span> which avoids the file dialog box by 
  specifying the file directly and of course the functional form <span class="mcode">
  plt('save','filename')</span> works also.</li>
  <li> <span class="mcode">
  plt&nbsp;open </span>opens a dialog box that allows you to select a .plt figure 
  file that was saved with the plt save menu. The new window should look and 
  behave the same as the original plt window. (Note that if the original plt 
  window was created with a function that provided additional plotting features 
  to the plt window, those features will not be available after opening the 
  figure.) This menu item is equivalent to typing <span class="mcode">
  plt&nbsp;open</span> at the Matlab command prompt. Also at the command prompt, you 
  may type <span class="mcode">
  plt&nbsp;open&nbsp;filename</span> which avoids the file dialog box by specifying the 
  file directly. A new window is opened containing the data that was saved.</li>
  <li> <span class="mcode">
  plt&nbsp;hardCopy </span>opens a dialog box used for printing and creating 
  screen captures of plt figures. As mentioned above, the general Maltab print 
  command is used for the same purpose however in some cases the plt hardCopy 
  dialog box may provide more flexibility, especially for creating  
  screen captures in bmp, post script, or win meta formats. The use of the hardCopy dialog box is described 
above under &quot;Menu box&quot;, &quot;Print&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../images/pltMenu.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="30"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last menu item (<span class="mcode">plt</span>) is unique to plt. 
When you click on this menu item you will see these eight submenus.</p>
<p>To change the color or other property of a trace or of its associated cursor, 
first click on the trace that you want to modify (i.e. make the trace active) 
and then click on the <span class="mcode">Edit&nbsp;line</span> submenu. You 
will see a new figure similar to the one below. Note that the three property 
editing windows shown below may also be opened from the &quot;Properties&quot; selection 
that appears when you right click on the Yedit cursor. (See
<a href="Data%20editing.htm">Data editing</a>.)</p>
<br clear=left>
<h3>Editing line, cursor, and figure properties</h3>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../images/color2.png" align="left" hspace="10"></p>
<p>As you can see from the submenu, you can also bring up the edit line figure 
by pressing the &lt;Control E&gt; hot key. (Right clicking on the <span class="mcode">Mark</span> tag 
in the menu box is yet a third way to bring up the edit line dialog box. That 
might be quicker if the menu bar is hidden.)</p>
<p>The left side of the Edit Line dialog box 
controls the properties of the active trace and the right side controls the properties 
of the cursor attached to that trace. The properties that appear in both these popups 
are the same as those under &quot;Marker properties&quot; in the Edit Marker dialog box 
shown above. Note that 
one can edit the data plotted by selecting and editing the Xdata or Ydata line properties. This works 
well for simple traces with less than a few dozen data elements. For longer 
sequences you will be better off using&nbsp; the data editing technique described in 
the <a href="Data%20editing.htm">data editing</a> section. Note that (for 
example) if you modify the Ydata property by removing or adding data elements 
that the line will dissappear until you also modify the Xdata property by 
removing or adding the same number of points. This is because the line object 
can't be rendered unless the lengths of the Xdata and Ydata properties are the 
same.</p>
<p>If you want to edit the properties of the line associated with a right hand 
axis (if one has been enabled) you must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, right click on the TraceID tag 
associated with that trace (always the last one in the TraceID list) to make 
  that trace the only visible trace.</li>
  <li>Then make the trace active by clicking on it.</li>
  <li>Then select the <span class="mcode">Edit&nbsp;line</span> submenu (or press &lt;Cntrl&gt; 
  E)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../images/color2a.png" align="left" hspace="10">If you 
want to edit all the lines at once, click on the <span class="mcode">Edit all 
lines</span> submenu. A dialog box such as this will appear. (An alternate way 
to bring up ths dialog box is to first click on the &Delta; button to put the 
cursor in delta mode and then right 
click on the <span class="mcode">Mark</span> tag.) When you change the popup 
menu to select a new property, the edit box will be updated to show the current 
value of that property for the active trace just as before. However if you then 
change the property value in the edit box, this property will get changed for 
all the traces on the plot, not just the active trace. This is probably not 
appropriate for the color property, but it may be useful for some of the other 
trace properties, such as linewidth. You can also use this dialog box to make 
all the cursors larger or a different shape for instance.<br clear="left">
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../images/color3.png" align="left" hspace="10"></p>
<p>The next submenu is <span class="mcode">Edit&nbsp;figure&nbsp;colors</span> which 
brings up this dialog box. From this dialog box you can change all of the figure 
colors which are not accessible from the edit lines dialog boxes described 
above.<br clear="left">
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../images/color3a.png" align="left" hspace="10"></p>
<p>These are the eight items that you can modify from the
<span class="mcode">Edit&nbsp;figure&nbsp;colors</span> dialog box.
After selecting one of these items, the current 
color of that item appears in the edit box below the popup as a set of three 
intensity numbers corresponding to red, green, and blue respectively. You may 
change the color by left clicking the edit box and entering the desired rgb 
values or by right clicking the edit box which will bring up the color selection 
box shown below:<br clear="left">
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Color Selection box</h3>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../images/color4.png" align="left" hspace="10"></p>
<p>When using the &quot;Edit&nbsp;Marker&quot;, &quot;Edit&nbsp;line&quot;, &quot;Edit&nbsp;all&nbsp;lines&quot;, or &quot;Edit&nbsp;figure&nbsp;colors&quot; dialog boxes described above, if you right click on an edit box 
containing an rgb triple, the color selection box will appear.</p>
<p>As with the rgb triples, the three sliders represent the intensity values (except in percent) and will initially be set to the same values that were in 
the edit box. You can move the sliders (or type in new values) to give the 
proportion of each color that you want. Only integer values between 0 and 100 
are accepted giving you more than a million different colors (101 cubed). As you 
move the sliders, the color of the marker, line, or figure element selected is 
continually adjusted to reflect the slider settings. The color of the large 
rectangular patch to the right of the red slider (called the &quot;current color 
patch&quot;)&nbsp; is also adjusted at the same 
time which makes it easier especially for the smaller screen elements.</p>
<p>To make it easier to find the most pleasing color, the 11 by 11 grid of 
colors is also updated every time a slider is moved. What this grid shows you 
are the colors that result when the intensity value of the active slider is 
mixed with 1 of 11 different intensity values of the two inactive sliders. The 
active slider (i.e. the slider that was last moved) is shown highlighted in 
yellow.</p>
<p>So for example, in the figure above, the bottom slider (blue) is active and 
happens to be set to 0%. This means that all 121 squares of the grid are made up 
of colors containing no blue. Each row of the grid contains a different 
intensity percentage of red (0% for the bottom row, 10% for the next row, and 
100% for the top row). Likewise each column of the grid contains a different 
intensity percentage of green (0% for the left column and 100% for the right 
column). Thus, the upper right square in this example then would be yellow (rgb&nbsp;=&nbsp;[1 1 0]).</p>
<p>When you see a color in the grid that you like, just click on it. The screen 
element selected as well as the current color patch will instantly change to 
be the same as the color you clicked on. Of course the two inactive sliders move 
to show the intensity values of the color you just selected. If you can't find a 
better color, you can revert to the color in effect when you right clicked on 
the rgb triple by clicking on the current color patch.</p>
<p>All this may sound somewhat complicated, however it is far easier to do than 
to explain. Generally you can pick any of the three sliders, move it around a 
bit, and you will quickly see the color you want in the grid. By the way, 
clicking on the slider trough area moves the slider by 10%, so if you want to 
limit yourself to the 1,331 colors formed with the intensities 
0,10,20,30,...100%, then you can see all such colors after just 10 clicks of the 
mouse.</p>
<h3>Save figure colors</h3>
<p>Changing colors inside the plt figure using the color selection box is not 
permanent (i.e. those colors will be forgotten once the application is closed). 
However you can make the changes permanent by selecting the last choice in the 
color menu (<span class="mcode">Save&nbsp;figure&nbsp;colors</span>). Selecting that 
submenu will save the current colors to the color file. You will find the rules 
that plt uses to determine the color file name in the description of the <span class="mcode">
'ColorFile'</span> parameter <a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Colors.htm">
here</a>.</p>
<p>When plt starts, the color for each screen element is determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a color file is found, the color for all screen elements will be 
  determined by the file contents.</li>
  <li>If no color file exists, the colors for particular screen elements are 
  determined by the color parameters included in the plt function call. These 
  parameters are described <a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Colors.htm">
  here</a>.</li>
  <li>If such a parameter is not included in the function call, then the color 
  for that particular screen element will be specified by the plt default color 
  scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p>These color files are in a consistent format so a color file generated in one 
application can be used in another application by renaming the color file, or by 
using the name of the desired color file explicitly with the <span class="mcode">
'ColorFile'</span> parameter. It's possible to edit the color files in the 
MatLab command window (load, edit save), however it is usually easier to edit 
them in the same application that created them.</p>
<h3>Delete cursor annotations</h3>
The next three selections in the plt menu are also available from the gui without
the menu enabled. The "Open Data Cursor Window" is available by right clicking on
the Menu tag, The "Swap X/Y Axis" is available by right clicking on the LinX tag,
and the "Toggle Line Smoothing" is available by right clicking on the "O" button.
However the last menu selection ("Delete cursor annotations") is only available
from the menu bar. If you want to delete the annotations one by one, you can
right click on the annotations and delete the string and/or marker from the
Edit Marker window. However if you have many annotations, this menu item provides
a way to delete them with one simple action.
