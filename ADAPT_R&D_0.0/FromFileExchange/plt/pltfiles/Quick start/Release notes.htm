		<li>Enhancements to edit pseudo object: Values can now be continually incremented or decremented
		    by holding down the mouse button. Absolute incr/decr values may be specified (as before) or
		    now they may be specified as a percentage of the current value. incr/decr values may now
		    be used with floating point edit pseudo objects as well. (Zero increment disables this feature.)
		    Position may be specified in normalized units (as before) and now data units may be used as well.
		    The slider in the circles12.m demo program was changed to an edit pseudo object to illustrated its use.</li>
	        <li>Improved log grid lines. Now includes subdecade grids for 6 decades or less</li>
 		<li>HardCopy figure window now defaults properly for bmp files</li>
		<li>Improved appearance of the menu box (background and border colors)</li>
		<li>Added right click action to "LinY/LogY" tag. It now brings up the hard copy dialog.</li>
		<li>Added 'Link' parameter to force groups of plt figures to close together.
		    The demo programs editz.m and tasplt.m were modified to take advantage of this new parameter</li>
		<li>Enhanced a few of the functions plotted in curves.m</li>
		<li>Added images & thumbnails of all the example programs to the help file</li>
		<li>Fixed various bugs related to log axis scaling and panning</li>
		<li>Fixed LinX/LogX switching bug for subplots</li>
		<li>Fixed bug which prevented data editing of subplots</li>
                <li>Fixed bugs with the subplot parameter and in the weight.m demo program</li>
		<li>Fixed bug occuring when using the 'MoveCB' parameter with subplots</li>
		<li>Fixed bug occuring when right clicking on the grid tag using default colors</li>
		<li>Other minor bug fixes.<br></li>

    <ul>
                <li>Renamed <span class="mcode">vbar.m, ebar.m, quiv.m, and ftoa.m </span>
		to <span class="mcode">Pvbar, Pebar, Pquiv, and Pftoa </span> to reduce the
		probability of name collisions (since these files typically reside in
		the plt folder on the matlab path).</li>
		<li>Added <span class="mcode">Linesmoothing</span> to the list of strings
		that may appear in the
		<a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Options.htm">Options</a> parameter.
		When this option is specified, the Linesmoothing property of the traces is set
		which tells Matlab to use anti-aliasing techniques to make the traces look
		smoother. You can also toggle the Linesmoothing property by right clicking
		on the marker button (labeled with "o"). See important details about this
		property in the
		<a href="../Using%20the%20plt%20window/Cursoring.htm">Cursoring</a> section</li> 
		<li>Changed the default characteristics of the grid lines. The new default is
		solid lines instead of dashed lines and the default color has changed from
		dim grey (30%) to very dim gray (13%). Also the default erase mode for the
		grid lines has changed from 'norm' to 'xor', The grid linestyle may now be selected
		by using the new <span class="mcode">GridStyle</span> parameter. The Linestyle
		parameter was also added to the 'init' action of the grid pseudo object.
		The grid lines used to update only when a zoom or pan operation was complete, but
		this has been changed so that the grid lines are now updated during the pan
		and zoom operations. The color file format was updated to include the grid
		lines erase mode as well as the new GridStyle parameter</li>
		<li>Left clicking on the Grid tag in the menu box has the same meaning as
		before (i.e. toggling between grid lines and ticks) however now you can also
		right click on the Grid tag. The effect of this right click is to toggle back
		and forth between the current default grid style and something similar to
		the older grid style (i.e. slightly brighter grey dashed lines in normal
		erase mode).</li>
		<li>Left clicking on the Menu tag in the menu box has the same meaning as before
		(i.e. toggling the menu bar visibility) but there is a new meaning to right
		clicking on the Menu tag. The effect of this right click is to open a new
		figure window containing a textual view of the trace data. See
		<b><i>Cursor Data Window</i></b> in the
		<a href="../Using%20the%20plt%20window/Menu%20box.htm">Menu box</a> section</li>
		<li>Replaced the "Color/Lines" heading in the menu bar (which included 4 submenus)
		    with the "plt" heading containing the original 4 submenus and 4 additional ones.
		    Three of the new menus mirror right click actions of the GUI objects, but the menu
		    bar makes the actions easier to discover and remember. The 4th action
		    (Delete Cursor Annotations) is a new feature which allows you to quickly delete
		    all annotations entered using the Mark tag. (Previously these annotations
		    could only be deleted one at a time.)</li>
		<li>Added the swap x/y action which swaps the x and y data of all traces
		   (i.e. displays inverse functions). This action is available from the menu bar
		   (plt menu) as well as by right clicking on the <span class="mcode">LinX</span> tag</i>
		<li>The installation has been simplified by always including both the compiled help
		file (plt.chm) as well as the all individual html files used to create it.
		By default PC systems will open the plt.chm compiled help file and Unix based systems
		will open plt.htm (the top level html file). However you can change these defaults.
		See the <a href="Installation instructions.htm">Installation instructions</a> for details.</li>
		<li>As before the <span class="mcode">HelpFile</span> parameter modifies the
		help tag left click action. In a similar manner, the new
		<span class="mcode">HelpFileR</span> parameter modifies help tag right click action.
		For a full description of these parameters see
		<a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Options.htm">Options</a>.</li>
		<li>Enhancements to the ColorPick pseudo object.</li>
		<li>Improvements to the example programs include:
		<ul><li><i>Fontsize</i> popup added to <span class="mcode">demoplt.m</span>
		    <li><i># of lines</i> control added to <span class="mcode">pltn.m</span>
		    <li><i>Cycle</i> button added to <span class="mcode">curves.m</span>
		    <li>The upper plot in <span class="mcode">editz.m</span> now demonstrates the use of Dual Cursors.
		    <li>Other more minor enhancements.
		</ul>
		<li>Y-axis metric prefixes are now disabled when using the SubTrace parameter</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug which sometimes prevented you from being able to close the plt window.</li>
		<li>Many other bug fixes and documentation improvements.</li>

    <ul>
                <li>Removed the <span class="mcode">plt('ftoa') </span>
		and <span class="mcode">plt('vtoa') </span>commands and replaced and expanded on this
		functionality with the seperate functions <span class="mcode">prin.m</span> and
		<span class="mcode">ftoa.m</span>. (ftoa is called by prin and is not usually called directly)
		See the new file <a href="../../prin.pdf">prin.pdf</a> &nbsp;for a description.
		Modified <span class="mcode">demo\pub.m</span> as well as several of the other
		example programs to take advantage of the new features provided by the
		<span class="mcode">prin()</span> function.</li>
		<li>The cursor control buttons (a group of buttons in lower left corner) previously
		consisted of 3 buttons (peak finder, valley finder, and delta cursor). As of this release
		a 4th button is included in this group (called the marker button) and is labeled with
		the letter "o". The function of this new button is described in the
		<a href="../Using%20the%20plt%20window/Cursoring.htm">Cursoring</a> section
		but if you click on this button 3 times you will already know all it does.</li>
		<li>Left/right clicking on the x-axis label still moves the cursor left/right one data
		element as it did before, but now this has been enhanced so that the cursor continues
		to move as long as you hold down the mouse button. The default repeat rate is 33 times
		a second, but this is adjustable. See the full description in the
		<a href="../Using%20the%20plt%20window/Cursoring.htm">Cursoring</a> section. This gives
		the x-axis label nearly all the features of the optional x-axis slider without taking
		up any extra space.</li>
		<li>Including the letters <span class="mcode">H </span>or<span class="mcode"> Hidden </span>
		in the options string now instructs plt to leave the plt figure hidden until the figure
		visibility property is latter set to 'on'.</li>		
		<li>Fixed a bug that appeared only on MACs that caused incorrect displays of some
	        floating point numbers in edit boxes.</li>

		and plotyy.</li>
		<li>Added the ColorPick pseudo object.&nbsp; (See
		<a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Pseudo%20objects.htm">Pseudo objects</a>). 
		The demoplt.m function was modified to demonstrate how to use 
		this new pseudo object.</li>
		<li>The data editing capabilities of plt (See
		<a href="../Using%20the%20plt%20window/Data%20editing.htm">Data editing</a> )
		were completely revamped, both to make it easier to use and to allow
		its use with subplots. The <span class="mcode">demo\editz.m</span> demo

    <ul>
      <li>Added the <span class="mcode">'SubTrace'</span> parameter to allow 
      more flexibility on how traces are assigned to the various subplot axes. 
      (See <a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Axis%20properties.htm">
      SubTrace Parameter</a>)</li>
      <li>Added a new interpretation of the <span class="mcode">'SubPlot'</span> 
      parameter which allows you to adjust the spacing between two columns of 
      subplots. (See
      <a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Axis%20properties.htm">Subplot 
      Parameter</a>)</li>
      <li>The demo program <span class="mcode">demo\pub.m</span> was expanded to 
      include yet one more plot to show how subplots can be used when formatting 
      plots for publication and to show how the SubTrace parameter is used.</li>
      <li>Fixed bugs which were causing the delta cursor and peak/valley finder 
      features to work incorrectly when using Matlab 2009b or newer.</li>
      <li>Fixed bugs which caused the <span class="mcode">AxisPos</span> 
      parameter to be interpreted incorrectly when used with subplots.</li>
      <li>Added the <span class="mcode">'MotionEdit'</span> parameter which 
      allows you to specify a function to be executed while the mouse is being 
      moved during a data edit operation. (See
      <a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Cursor%20commands.htm">Mouse Motion 
      Functions</a>.) The <span class="mcode">demo\editz.m</span>&nbsp; program 
      was updated to take advantage of this feature. If you have used previous 
      versions of editz (which updated the plots only after you have selected 
      the final root location), you will recognize the benefit of seeing 
      the transfer function plot update in real time as you drag a root to a new 
      location.</li>
      <li>In a similar vain to 'MotionEdit' the <span class="mcode">'MotionZoom'</span> 
      parameter was added which allows you to specify a function to be executed 
      while the mouse is being moved during a display zoom operation (i.e. while 
      the zoom box is being dragged). (See
      <a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Cursor%20commands.htm">Mouse Motion 
      Functions</a>.) The <span class="mcode">demo\gauss.m</span>

      folder to show how to optimize a plot for publication (instead of the 
      typical data exploration uses of plt). Also demonstrates the use of the 
      new property prefix characters described below.</li>
      <li>Previously there were two property prefix characters ('<span class="mcode">+</span>', 
      '<span class="mcode">-</span>') which refer to the left and right axis 
      properties. (Without the prefix characters plt assumes properties are to 
      be applied to the line objects.) Now three additional prefix characters 
      have been added ('<span class="mcode">&lt;</span>', '<span class="mcode">&gt;</span>', 
      '<span class="mcode">.</span>') which refer the properties to the left 
      y-label, right y-label and x-label respectively. A property may be 
      preceded by more than one prefix character.&nbsp; For example <span class="mcode">
      '&gt;.-FontSize',14</span>&nbsp; will change the font size of the right 
      y-label, the x-label and the tick marks of the right hand axis. See

      <li>The <span class="mcode">SubPlot</span> parameter was added, a major 
      enhancement in plt's ability to place multiple plots in a figure window. 
      This is more flexible and far easier to use than the subplot method 
      introduced in version 19Aug08. The <span class="mcode">demo\subplt.m</span> 
      and <span class="mcode">subplt8.m</span> examples were rewritten to use 
      the new SubPlot parameter. The <span class="mcode">weight.m</span> example 
      (which was also simplified by using the new parameter) also demonstrates a 
      trick for allowing multiple traces in each subplot. See <a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Axis%20properties.htm">
      Axis properties</a><span class="mcode"> </span>for a complete description of the 
      SubPlot parameter.</li>
      <li>The <span class="mcode">
      Xlim</span> and <span class="mcode">
      LabelX</span> parameters now allow cell array inputs so that they may 
      specify values for the right hand column of subplots. The <span class="mcode">
      LabelY</span> parameter now allows a cell array input so that you can 
      specify labels for all the subplots as well as for the right hand axis of 
      the main plot, and <span class="mcode">
      Ylim</span> parameter can take a cell array input to specify limits for 
      both the left and right hand axis of the main plot.</li>
      <li>Added an easier way to remove cursor objects for production plots. See 
      the <span class="mcode">
      -All</span> and the <span class="mcode">

      <a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Auxiliary%20plt%20functions.htm">
      Auxiliary plt functions</a>). Also the default erase mode for the grids 
      has changed from xor to normal. You may select the exclusive-or erase mode for the 
      grids by specifying a grid color containing a negative value (e.g. <span class="mcode">
      'GRIDc',[0 -.2 .4]</span>). The actual grid color used in this example is 
      [0 .2 .4]).</li>
      <li>Added a special case to the<span class="mcode"> 
      plt('cursor',cid,'set','activeLine',a,k)</span> command for when a is zero. (See
      <a href="../Command%20line%20arguments/Cursor%20commands.htm">Cursor

      w</span> is complex) is equivalent to including the two arguments &quot;<span class="mcode">real(w),imag(w)</span>&quot;. 
      In earlier revisions this was only true sometimes.</li>
      <li>The delta button is now highlighted whenever the delta cursor mode has 
      been selected.</li>
      <li>Left clicking on the up/down arrow buttons moves to the next 
      peak/valley respectively as before. Also as before, clicking on the trace 
      resets the peak or valley finder so that the next click of the up/down 
      arrow brings you to the largest peak or smallest valley. Now, the 
      resetting of the peak or valley finder may also be accomplished by <i>
      right</i> clicking on the up/down arrow button.</li>
      <li>Added files:<br>
      <span class="mcode">vbar.m</span> - for displaying functions as vertical 
      bars<br>
      <span class="mcode">ebar.m</span> - for displaying error bars<br>
      <span class="mcode">quiv.m</span> - for displaying vector fields 
      (arrows)</li>
      <li>The functionality of quiv.m is similar to Matlab's quiver.m although 
      unlike quiver, quiv doesn't call plot. Therefore you must call plot or plt 
      with the data generated by quiv. In earlier versions of plt, the code in 
      quiv.m was inside plt.p, but I extracted it to a separate function to 
      provide more flexibility and a cleaner user interface.</li>
      <li>In the previous release, all the files were in the same folder. In 
      this release a new folder named &quot;<span class="mcode">demo</span>&quot; was 
      added to contain all the example programs.</li>
      <li>A new program named <span class="mcode">demoplt.m</span> was added (in 
      the demo folder) which runs all 12 example programs in succession. Every 
      time you press &lt;Enter&gt; demoplt will close the current example and start up 
      the next one.</li>
      <li>A new example program named <span class="mcode">pltvbar.m</span> was 
      added to demonstrate the use of <span class="mcode">vbar.m</span> and <span class="mcode">
      ebar.m</span> .</li>
      <li>The <span class="mcode">pltquiv.m</span> example program was modified 
      to use the new <span class="mcode">quiv.m</span> function.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>A new parameter (<span class="mcode">'Right'</span>) was added to 
      specify which traces should be on the right hand axis. In earlier plt 
      versions, only one trace was allowed on the right hand axis and it had to 
      be the last trace. Now you may place any or all of the traces on the right 
      axis. For example, in the argument list you could specify <span class="mcode">
      'Right',[1&nbsp;4:2:10&nbsp;17]</span>. Then plt would put trace numbers 1,4,6,8,10, 
      and 17 on the right axis and all other traces on the left axis. A slight 
      shading is used behind the Trace IDs associated with the right hand axis 
      so you can tell at a glance which traces belong to which axis. You can 
      also tell which axis a trace is on by the shape of its cursor (+/o for 
      left/right axis). As with earlier revisions, a right axis is created if 
      you include the <span class="mcode">'LabelYR'</span>, or <span class="mcode">
      'YlimR</span>' parameters in the argument list. For clarity, you should 
      also include the <span class="mcode">'Right'</span> parameter in that 
      case, however if omitted, plt will put the last trace on the right axis.</li>
      <li>A new parameter (<span class="mcode">'DualCur'</span>) was added to 
      control a feature I now call a dual cursor. The usual cursor can only show 
      the value of one of the visible traces on the plot. With a dual cursor, 
      two such values can be shown at the same time - especially useful 
      when displaying two tightly linked values (for example, the magnitude and 
      phase of a complex quantity). In earlier versions of plt, a dual cursor 
      was provided, however it was forced to be on the last trace only which was 
      also forced to be on the right hand axis. (Moreover the dual cursor was 
      not optional. If you wanted to use a right hand axis, you automatically 
      got a dual cursor). As of this version, you specify a dual cursor for 
      the Nth trace by including <span class="mcode">'DualCur',N</span> in the 
      parameter list. This means that trace N will never be the active trace and 
      so its value will never appear in the usual y value readout location 
      (immediately to the right of the &quot;y:&quot; cursor label). However when you 
      cursor any other trace, a cursor will also appear on trace N at the same 
      x-axis location and the value of trace N will appear just to the right 
      of the value for the active trace. The dual cursor is easily distinguished from the usual cursor by 
      its shape - an asterisk if the dual cursored trace is on the left axis or 
      a square if it is on the right axis.</li>
      <li>A new parameter (<span class="mcode">'TIDcback',fcn</span>) was added 
      to that one can define a callback function to be executed whenever the 
      user clicks on a Trace ID (i.e. a trace is enabled or disabled).</li>
      <li>The <span class="mcode">winplt</span> example program was updated to 
      show comparisons between previous window time shapes as well as the 
      previous frequency shapes. (In the earlier revision, only the previous 
      frequency shapes were saved). This takes advantage of plt's new ability to 
      put multiple traces on the right hand axis.</li>
